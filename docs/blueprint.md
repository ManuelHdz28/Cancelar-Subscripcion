# **App Name**: Unsubscribeasy

## Core Features:

- Email Link Generation: Generate a unique URL containing an encrypted email address. When clicked, this link will pass the email to the site.
- Unsubscribe Confirmation: Display a confirmation message to the user, asking if they wish to unsubscribe the displayed email address.
- Notification Email: Upon confirmation, send an email to the site owner's configured address, notifying them of the unsubscription request with the user's email address.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming light-blue (#89bdd3) to create a sense of ease and trust.
- Background color: Use a very light-blue (#f0f8ff) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Use a desaturated purple color (#8b86b1) for secondary interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a neutral and modern aesthetic, will provide clear and readable text throughout the interface.
- Employ simple, recognizable icons to represent actions and statuses, such as a trash can or 'x' for 'unsubscribe', ensuring intuitive interaction.
- Design a minimalist layout that prominently displays the email confirmation message and 'yes'/'no' buttons, emphasizing ease of use and quick decision-making.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and feedback animations (e.g., button highlighting on hover) to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
